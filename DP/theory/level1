How to solve a Dynamic Programming Problem ?
    If (all sub problems to be solved):
    	Tabulation
    else:
    	Memoization




Pros in Memoization:

    Doesnâ€™t attempt to solve all sub problems.

Pros in Tabulation:

    Can be done iteratively so less stack space.
    Memory can be efficiently used , Unnecessary states can be discarded

Step 1 : How to classify a problem as a Dynamic Programming Problem?

    Typically, all the problems that require to maximize or minimize certain quantity or counting problems that say to count the arrangements under certain condition or certain probability problems can be solved by using Dynamic Programming.
    All dynamic programming problems satisfy the overlapping subproblems property and most of the classic dynamic problems also satisfy the optimal substructure property. Once, we observe these properties in a given problem, be sure that it can be solved using DP.
